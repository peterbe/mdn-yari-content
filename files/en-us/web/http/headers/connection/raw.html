<p>The <strong><code>Connection</code></strong> general header controls whether or not the network connection stays open after the current transaction finishes. If the value sent is <code>keep-alive</code>, the connection is persistent and not closed, allowing for subsequent requests to the same server to be done.</p>

<div class="note">
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540#section-8.1.2.2">Connection-specific header fields such as <code>Connection</code> must not be used with HTTP/2.</a>
</div>

<p>Except for the standard hop-by-hop headers ({{HTTPHeader("Keep-Alive")}}, {{HTTPHeader("Transfer-Encoding")}}, {{HTTPHeader("TE")}}, {{HTTPHeader("Connection")}}, {{HTTPHeader("Trailer")}}, {{HTTPHeader("Upgrade")}}, {{HTTPHeader("Proxy-Authorization")}} and {{HTTPHeader("Proxy-Authenticate")}}), any hop-by-hop headers used by the message must be listed in the <code>Connection</code> header, so that the first proxy knows it has to consume them and not forward them further. Standard hop-by-hop headers can be listed too (it is often the case of {{HTTPHeader("Keep-Alive")}}, but this is not mandatory).</p>

 <dt><code>close</code></dt>
 <dd>Indicates that either the client or the server would like to close the connection. This is the default on HTTP/1.0 requests.</dd>
 <dt>any comma-separated list of HTTP headers [Usually <code>keep-alive</code> only]</dt>
 <dd>Indicates that the client would like to keep the connection open. Having a persistent connection is the default on HTTP/1.1 requests. The list of headers are the name of the header to be removed by the first non-transparent proxy or cache in-between: these headers define the connection between the emitter and the first entity, not the destination node.</dd>
