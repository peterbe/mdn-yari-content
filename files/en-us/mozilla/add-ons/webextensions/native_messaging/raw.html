<p>Native messaging enables an extension to exchange messages with a native application installed on the user's computer. This enables native applications to provide a service to extensions without needing to be reachable over the web. One common example here is password managers: the native application manages storage and encryption of passwords, and communicates with the extension to populate web forms. Native messaging also enables extensions to access resources that are not accessible through WebExtension APIs, such as some particular piece of hardware.</p>

<p>The native application is not installed or managed by the browser: it's installed using the underlying operating system's installation machinery. Along with the native application itself, you'll need to provide a JSON file called the "host manifest" or "app manifest", and install it in a defined location on the user's computer. The app manifest file describes how the browser can connect to the native application.</p>

<p>The extension must request the "nativeMessaging" <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/permissions">permission</a> in its manifest.json file. Conversely, the native application must grant permission for the extension by including its ID in the "allowed_extensions" field of the app manifest.</p>

<p>After that the extension can exchange JSON messages with the native application using a set of functions in the {{WebExtAPIRef("runtime")}} API. On the native app side, messages are received using standard input (stdin) and sent using standard output (stdout).</p>

<p>Support for native messaging in extensions is mostly compatible with Chrome, with two main differences:</p>

<ul>
 <li>The app manifest lists <code>allowed_extensions</code> as an array of app IDs, while Chrome lists <code>allowed_origins</code>, as an array of "chrome-extension" URLs.</li>
 <li>The app manifest is stored in a different location <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/nativeMessaging#native-messaging-host-location">compared to Chrome</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>There's a complete example in the <a href="https://github.com/mdn/webextensions-examples/tree/master/native-messaging">"native-messaging" directory</a> of the "webextensions-examples" repository on GitHub. Most of the example code in this article is taken from that example.</p>

<h2 id="Setup">Setup</h2>

<h3 id="Extension_manifest">Extension manifest</h3>

<p>If you want your extension to communicate with a native application, then:</p>

<ul>
 <li>You must set the "nativeMessaging" <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/permissions">permission</a> in its <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json">manifest.json</a> file.</li>
 <li>You should probably specify your add-on ID explicitly, using the <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/browser_specific_settings">browser_specific_settings</a> manifest key (This is because the app's manifest will identify the set of extensions that are allowed to connect to it by listing their IDs).</li>
</ul>

<p>Here's an example manifest.json file:</p>

<pre class="brush: json">{

  "description": "Native messaging example add-on",
  "manifest_version": 2,
  "name": "Native messaging example",
  "version": "1.0",
  "icons": {
    "48": "icons/message.svg"
  },

  "applications": {
    "gecko": {
      "id": "ping_pong@example.org",
      "strict_min_version": "50.0"
    }
  },

  "background": {
    "scripts": ["background.js"]
  },

  "browser_action": {
    "default_icon": "icons/message.svg"
  },
 
  "permissions": ["nativeMessaging"]

}</pre>

<div class="blockIndicator note">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Chrome does not support the <code>applications</code> key. You will need to use another manifest without this key to install an equivalent WebExtension on Chrome. See <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Native_messaging#Chrome_incompatibilities">Chrome incompatibilities below</a>.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="App_manifest">App manifest</h3>

<p>The app manifest describes to the browser how it can connect to the native application.</p>

<p>The app manifest file must be installed along with the native application. That is, the browser reads and validates app manifest files but it does not install or manage them. Thus the security model for when and how these files are installed and updated is much more like that for native applications than that for extensions using WebExtension APIs.</p>

<p>For details of native app manifest syntax and location, see <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Native_manifests">Native manifests</a>.</p>

<p>For example, here's a manifest for the "ping_pong" native application:</p>

<pre class="brush: json">{
  "name": "ping_pong",
  "description": "Example host for native messaging",
  "path": "/path/to/native-messaging/app/ping_pong.py",
  "type": "stdio",
  "allowed_extensions": [ "ping_pong@example.org" ]
}</pre>

<p>This allows the extension whose ID is "ping_pong@example.org" to connect, by passing the name "ping_pong" into the relevant {{WebExtAPIRef("runtime")}} API function. The application itself is at "/path/to/native-messaging/app/ping_pong.py".</p>

<div class="blockIndicator note">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Chrome identifies allowed extensions with another key: <code>allowed_origins</code>, using the ID of the WebExtension. Refer to <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/apps/nativeMessaging#native-messaging-host">Chrome documentation for more details </a>and see <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Native_messaging#Chrome_incompatibilities">Chrome incompatibilities below</a>.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="Windows_setup">Windows setup</h3>

<p>As an example, you can also refer to <a href="https://github.com/SphinxKnight/webextensions-examples/tree/master/native-messaging#windows-setup">the readme on the native messaging extension on GitHub</a>. If you want to check your local setup after having forked this repository on a Windows machine, you may run <code>check_config_win.py</code> to troubleshoot some issues.</p>

<h4 id="App_manifest_2">App manifest</h4>

<p><strong>I</strong>n the example above, the native application is a Python script. It can be difficult to get Windows to run Python scripts reliably in this way, so an alternative is to provide a .bat file, and link to that from the application's manifest:</p>

<pre class="brush: json">{
  "name": "ping_pong",
  "description": "Example host for native messaging",
  "path": "c:\\path\\to\\native-messaging\\app\\ping_pong_win.bat",
  "type": "stdio",
  "allowed_extensions": [ "ping_pong@example.org" ]
}</pre>

<p>(See note above about <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Native_messaging#Chrome_incompatibilities">Chrome compatiblity</a> regarding the <code>allowed_extensions</code> key and its counterpart in Chrome).</p>

<p>The batch file then invokes the Python script:</p>

<pre class="brush: bash">@echo off

python -u "c:\\path\\to\\native-messaging\\app\\ping_pong.py"</pre>

<h4 id="Registry">Registry</h4>

<p>The browser is able to find the extension based on registry keys which are located in a specific location. You need to add them either programmatically with your final application or manually if you are using the example from GitHub. For more details, refer to <a href="/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Native_manifests#Manifest_location">Manifest location</a>.</p>

<p>Following with the ping_pong example, if using Firefox (see <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/apps/nativeMessaging#native-messaging-host-location">this page for Chrome</a>), two registry entries should be created for the messaging to work:</p>

<ul>
 <li><code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Mozilla\NativeMessagingHosts\ping_pong</code>

  <ul>
   <li>The default value for this key should be the path to the <em>application</em> manifest: ex. <code>C:\Users\&lt;myusername&gt;\webextensions-examples\native-messaging\app\ping_pong.json</code></li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li><code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Mozilla\NativeMessagingHosts\ping_pong</code>
  <ul>
   <li>Idem, the default value for this key should be the path to the application manifest.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
</ul>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you base your work on the example located on GitHub, please read <a href="https://github.com/SphinxKnight/webextensions-examples/tree/master/native-messaging#windows-setup">this part of the readme</a> and check the output of <code>check_config_win.py</code> before installing the WebExtension on your browser.</p>
</div>

<ul>
</ul>

<h2 id="Exchanging_messages">Exchanging messages</h2>

<p>Given the above setup, an extension can exchange JSON messages with a native application.</p>

<h3 id="Extension_side">Extension side</h3>

<p>Native messaging cannot directly be used in content scripts; you'll need to <a href="/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Content_scripts#Communicating_with_background_scripts">do it indirectly via background scripts</a>.</p>

<p>There are two patterns to use here: connection-based messaging and connectionless messaging.</p>

<h4 id="Connection-based_messaging">Connection-based messaging</h4>

<p>With this pattern you call {{WebExtAPIRef("runtime.connectNative()")}}, passing the name of the application (the value of the "name" property in the app's manifest). This launches the application if it is not already running and returns a {{WebExtAPIRef("runtime.Port")}} object to the extension.</p>

<p>Two arguments are passed to the native app when it starts:</p>

<ul>
 <li>the complete path to the app manifest</li>
 <li>(new in Firefox 55) the ID (as given in the <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/browser_specific_settings">browser_specific_settings</a> manifest.json key) of the add-on that started it.</li>
</ul>

<div class="note">
<p>Chrome  handles the passed arguments differently:</p>

<ul>
 <li>On Linux and Mac, Chrome passes one argument, the origin of the extension that started it in the form: <code>chrome-extension://[extensionID]</code>. This enables the app to identify the extension.</li>
 <li>On Windows, Chrome passes two arguments: the first is the origin of the extension, and the second is a handle to the Chrome native window that started the app.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>The application stays running until the extension calls <code>Port.disconnect()</code> or the page that connected to it is closed.</p>

<p>To send messages using <code>Port</code>, call its <code>postMessage()</code> function, passing the JSON message to send. To listen for messages using <code>Port</code>, add the listener using its <code>onMessage.addListener()</code> function.</p>

<p>Here's an example background script that establishes a connection with the "ping_pong" app, listens for messages from it, then sends it a "ping" message whenever the user clicks the browser action:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">/*
On startup, connect to the "ping_pong" app.
*/
var port = browser.runtime.connectNative("ping_pong");

/*
Listen for messages from the app.
*/
port.onMessage.addListener((response) =&gt; {
  console.log("Received: " + response);
});

/*
On a click on the browser action, send the app a message.
*/
browser.browserAction.onClicked.addListener(() =&gt; {
  console.log("Sending:  ping");
  port.postMessage("ping");
});</pre>

<h4 id="Connectionless_messaging">Connectionless messaging</h4>

<p>With this pattern you call {{WebExtAPIRef("runtime.sendNativeMessage()")}}, passing it:</p>

<ul>
 <li>the name of the application</li>
 <li>the JSON message to send</li>
 <li>optionally, a callback.</li>
</ul>

<p>A new instance of the app is created for each message. The app is passed two arguments when it starts:</p>

<ul>
 <li>the complete path to the app manifest</li>
 <li>(new in Firefox 55) the ID (as given in the <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/browser_specific_settings">browser_specific_settings</a> manifest.json key) of the add-on that started it.</li>
</ul>

<p>The first message sent by the app is treated as a response to the <code>sendNativeMessage()</code> call, and will be passed into the callback.</p>

<p>Here's the example above, rewritten to use <code>runtime.sendNativeMessage()</code>:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">function onResponse(response) {
  console.log("Received " + response);
}

function onError(error) {
  console.log(`Error: ${error}`);
}

/*
On a click on the browser action, send the app a message.
*/
browser.browserAction.onClicked.addListener(() =&gt; {
  console.log("Sending:  ping");
  var sending = browser.runtime.sendNativeMessage(
    "ping_pong",
    "ping");
  sending.then(onResponse, onError);
});
</pre>

<h3 id="App_side">App side</h3>

<p>On the application side, you use standard input to receive messages and standard output to send them.</p>

<p>Each message is serialized using JSON, UTF-8 encoded and is preceded with a 32-bit value containing the message length in native byte order.</p>

<p>The maximum size of a single message from the application is 1 MB. The maximum size of a message sent to the application is 4 GB.</p>

<p>You can quickly get started sending and receiving messages with this NodeJS code:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">#!/usr/local/bin/node

process.stdin.on('readable', () =&gt; {
  var input = []
  var chunk
  while (chunk = process.stdin.read()) {
    input.push(chunk)
  }
  input = Buffer.concat(input)

  var msgLen = input.readUInt32LE(0)
  var dataLen = msgLen + 4

  if (input.length &gt;= dataLen) {
    var content = input.slice(4, dataLen)
    var json = JSON.parse(content.toString())
    handleMessage(json)
  }
})

function sendMessage(msg) {
  var header = Buffer.alloc(4);
  header.writeUInt32LE(msg.length, 0);

  process.stdout.write(header);
  process.stdout.write(msg);
}

process.on('uncaughtException', (err) =&gt; {
  sendMessage({error: err.toString()})
})</pre>

<p>Here's another example written in Python. It listens for messages from the extension. Note that the file has to be executable on Linux. If the message is "ping", then it responds with a message "pong". This is the Python 2 version:</p>

<pre class="brush: python">#!/usr/bin/python -u

# Note that running python with the `-u` flag is required on Windows,
# in order to ensure that stdin and stdout are opened in binary, rather
# than text, mode.

import json
import sys
import struct


# Read a message from stdin and decode it.
def get_message():
    raw_length = sys.stdin.read(4)
    if not raw_length:
        sys.exit(0)
    message_length = struct.unpack('=I', raw_length)[0]
    message = sys.stdin.read(message_length)
    return json.loads(message)


# Encode a message for transmission, given its content.
def encode_message(message_content):
    encoded_content = json.dumps(message_content)
    encoded_length = struct.pack('=I', len(encoded_content))
    return {'length': encoded_length, 'content': encoded_content}


# Send an encoded message to stdout.
def send_message(encoded_message):
    sys.stdout.write(encoded_message['length'])
    sys.stdout.write(encoded_message['content'])
    sys.stdout.flush()


while True:
    message = get_message()
    if message == "ping":
        send_message(encode_message("pong"))</pre>

<p>In Python 3, the received binary data has to be decoded into a string. The content to be sent back to the addon has to be encoded into binary data using a struct:</p>

<pre class="brush: python">#!/usr/bin/python -u

# Note that running python with the `-u` flag is required on Windows,
# in order to ensure that stdin and stdout are opened in binary, rather
# than text, mode.

import json
import sys
import struct


# Read a message from stdin and decode it.
def get_message():
    raw_length = sys.stdin.buffer.read(4)

    if not raw_length:
        sys.exit(0)
    message_length = struct.unpack('=I', raw_length)[0]
    message = sys.stdin.buffer.read(message_length).decode("utf-8")
    return json.loads(message)


# Encode a message for transmission, given its content.
def encode_message(message_content):
    encoded_content = json.dumps(message_content).encode("utf-8")
    encoded_length = struct.pack('=I', len(encoded_content))
    # use struct.pack("10s", bytes), to pack a string of the length of 10 characters
    return {'length': encoded_length, 'content': struct.pack(str(len(encoded_content))+"s",encoded_content)}


# Send an encoded message to stdout.
def send_message(encoded_message):
    sys.stdout.buffer.write(encoded_message['length'])
    sys.stdout.buffer.write(encoded_message['content'])
    sys.stdout.buffer.flush()


while True:
    message = get_message()
    if message == "ping":
        send_message(encode_message("pong"))</pre>

<h2 id="Closing_the_native_app">Closing the native app</h2>

<p>If you connected to the native application using <code>runtime.connectNative()</code>, then it stays running until the extension calls <code>Port.disconnect()</code> or the page that connected to it is closed. If you started the native application by sending <code>runtime.sendNativeMessage()</code>, then it is closed after it has received the message and sent a response.</p>

<p>To close the native application:</p>

<ul>
 <li>On *nix systems like OS X and Linux, the browser sends SIGTERM to the native application, then SIGKILL after the application has had a chance to exit gracefully. These signals propagate to any subprocesses unless they break away into a new process group.</li>
 <li>On Windows, the browser puts the native application's process into a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms684161(v=vs.85).aspx">Job object</a>, and kills the job. If the native application launches any additional processes and wants them to remain open after the native application itself is killed, then the native application must launch the additional process with the <code><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms684863(v=vs.85).aspx">CREATE_BREAKAWAY_FROM_JOB</a></code> flag.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>

<p>If something goes wrong, check the <a href="/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Debugging#Viewing_log_output">browser console</a>. If the native application sends any output to stderr, the browser will redirect it to the browser console. So if you've got as far as launching the native application, you will see any error messages it emits.</p>

<p>If you haven't managed to run the application, you should see an error message giving you a clue about the problem.</p>

<pre>"No such native application &lt;name&gt;"</pre>

<ul>
 <li> Check that the name passed to <code>runtime.connectNative()</code> matches the name in the app manifest</li>
 <li>OS X/Linux: check that name of the app manifest is &lt;name&gt;.json.</li>
 <li>OS X/Linux: check the native application's manifest file location as mentioned <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Native_manifests#Mac_OS_X">here</a>. </li>
 <li>Windows: check that the registry key is in the correct place, and that its name matches the name in the app manifest.</li>
 <li>Windows: check that the path given in the registry key points to the app manifest.</li>
