<p class="summary">到目前為止，我們已經在本課程中查看了很多文本，但是網絡只會使用文本而感到無聊。讓我們開始研究如何通過更有趣的內容讓網絡變得活躍起來！本單元探討瞭如何使用HTML在您的網頁中包含多媒體，包括可以包含圖像的不同方式，以及如何嵌入視頻，音頻甚至整個網頁。</p>

<h2 id="Prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>

<p>Before starting this module, you should have a reasonable knowledge of the basics of HTML, as previously covered in <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML">Introduction to HTML</a>. If you've not worked through this module (or something similar), work through it first, then come back!</p>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you are working on a computer/tablet/other device where you don't have the ability to create your own files, you could try out (most of) the code examples in an online coding program such as <a href="https://jsbin.com/">JSBin</a> or <a href="https://thimble.mozilla.org/">Thimble</a>.</p>

<p>This module contains the following articles which will take you through all the fundamentals of embedding multimedia on webpages.</p>

<dl>
 <dt><a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Images_in_HTML">Images in HTML</a></dt>
 <dd>There are other types of multimedia to consider, but it is logical to start with the humble {{htmlelement("img")}} element used to embed a simple image in a webpage. In this article we'll look at how to use it in more depth, including basics, annotating it with captions using {{htmlelement("figure")}}, and how it relates to CSS background images.</dd>
 <dt><a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Video_and_audio_content">Video and audio content</a></dt>
 <dd>Next, we'll look at how to use the HTML5 {{htmlelement("video")}} and {{htmlelement("audio")}} elements to embed video and audio on our pages, including basics, providing access to different file formats to different browsers, adding captions and subtitles, and how to add fallbacks for older browsers.</dd>
 <dt><a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Other_embedding_technologies">From &lt;object&gt; to &lt;iframe&gt; — other embedding technologies</a></dt>
 <dd>At this point we'd like to take somewhat of a sideways step, looking at a couple of elements that allow you to embed a wide variety of content types into your webpages: the {{htmlelement("iframe")}}, {{htmlelement("embed")}} and {{htmlelement("object")}} elements. <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>s are for embedding other web pages, and the other two allow you to embed PDFs, SVG, and even Flash — a technology on its way out, but which you may still see semi-regularly.</dd>
 <dt><a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Adding_vector_graphics_to_the_Web">Adding vector graphics to the web</a></dt>
 <dd>Vector graphics can be very useful in certain situations. Unlike regular formats like PNG/JPG, they don't distort/pixelate when zoomed in — they can remain smooth when scaled. This article introduces you to what vector graphics are and how to include the popular {{glossary("SVG")}} format in web pages.</dd>
 <dt><a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images">Responsive images</a></dt>
 <dd>With so many different device types now able to browse the web — from mobile phones to desktop computers — an essential concept to master in the modern web world is responsive design. This refers to the creation of webpages that can automatically change their features to suit different screen sizes, resolutions, etc. This will be looked at in much more detail in a CSS module later on, but for now, we'll look at the tools HTML has available to create responsive images, including the {{htmlelement("picture")}} element.</dd>

<h2 id="Assessments">Assessments</h2>

<p>The following assessments will test your understanding of the HTML basics covered in the guides above:</p>

<dl>
 <dt><a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Mozilla_splash_page">Mozilla splash page</a></dt>
 <dd>In this assessment, we'll test your knowledge of some of the techniques discussed in this module's articles, getting you to add some images and video to a funky splash page all about Mozilla!</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="See_also">See also</h2>

<dl>
 <dt><a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Howto/Add_a_hit_map_on_top_of_an_image">Add a hitmap on top of an image</a></dt>
 <dd>Image maps provide a mechanism to make different parts of an image link to different places. (Think of a map linking through to further information about each different country you click on.) This technique can sometimes be useful.</dd>
 <dt><a href="https://teach.mozilla.org/activities/web-lit-basics-two/">Web literacy basics 2</a></dt>
 <dd>
 <p>An excellent Mozilla foundation course that explores and tests some of the skills talked about in this <em>Multimedia and embedding</em> module. Dive deeper into the basics of composing webpages, designing for accessibility, sharing resources, using online media, and working open (meaning that your content is freely available and shareable by others).</p>
